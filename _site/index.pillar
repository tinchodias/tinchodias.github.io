In my *thesis>http://rmod.inria.fr/archives/phd/PhD-2015-Dias.pdf* I've worked in software evolution, first-class code changes, code integration activities, and untangling code changes.

Previously, I've studied at *Computer Department>http://www.dc.uba.ar/* of the *University of Buenos Aires>http://www.uba.ar/internacionales/index.php?lang=en*, where I received my degree in Computer Sciences.
