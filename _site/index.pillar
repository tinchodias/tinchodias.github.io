! About me

I have over twenty years of programming experience, as well as a few years as a teacher and researcher (computer science).

I currently work as a software engineer for *Pharo>https://consortium.pharo.org/*.
My tasks are focused on development of *Bloc>https://github.com/pharo-graphics/Bloc* and its associated graphics library ecosystem: implementing new features, bugfixing and others.

During 2018-21, I did research and develop software with focus on data visualization.
My advisor was *Alexandre Bergel>https://bergel.eu/*, and this happened, first, in the context of a *FONDECYT>https://www.conicyt.cl/fondecyt/sobre-fondecyt/que-es-fondecyt/* postdoc position at *University of Chile>http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/*, and later as an employee of *Object Profile SpA>https://www.portalchile.org/empresa/object-profile-spa-76190519*.

During 2016-18, I worked as a teacher at *University of Quilmes>https://www.unq.edu.ar/carrera/58-licenciatura-en-informatica/*, and also as developer of web applications.

In 2015, I've got a Ph.D. at *University of Lille>https://international.univ-lille.fr/* under the supervision of *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/* and *Damien Cassou>http://damiencassou.seasidehosting.st/*. 
I was part of *RMoD research group>https://rmod.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/* at *Inria>http://www.inria.fr/*.
My *thesis>https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/Team/Texts/Phds/PhD-2015-Dias.pdf* was related to software evolution, first-class code changes, code integration activities, and untangling code changes.

I did my studies in Computer Science at the *University of Buenos Aires>http://www.dc.uba.ar/*. 
My *master thesis>http://gestion.dc.uba.ar/media/academic/grade/thesis/dias.pdf* was centered on the creation of a Pharo serialization library that is still alive in the Smalltalk community (*Fuel>http://rmod.inria.fr/web/software/Fuel/*).
My supervisors were *Hernán Wilkinson>https://staff.dc.uba.ar/hwilkinson/*, *Carlos E. Ferro>https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-ferro-3025302/*, and *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/*.

Simultaneously with my university career, I got my first jobs as programmer for several companies (e.g. *Hexacta>http://www.hexacta.com/*).
