! About me

I work as a freelance developer and as a teacher at Universidad de Quilmes, Buenos Aires.

In 2015, I've got a Ph.D. at University of Lille (France) under the supervision of *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/* and *Damien Cassou>http://damiencassou.seasidehosting.st/*. 
I was part of *RMoD research group>http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/* at *Inria>http://www.inria.fr/*.
In my *thesis>http://rmod.inria.fr/archives/phd/PhD-2015-Dias.pdf* I've worked in software evolution, first-class code changes, code integration activities, and untangling code changes.

Previously, I've studied at the *Departamento de Computación>http://www.dc.uba.ar/*, *Universidad de Buenos Aires>http://dc.uba.ar/*, where I received my degree in Computer Sciences. 
In my *master thesis>http://www.dc.uba.ar/inv/tesis/licenciatura/2012/dias.pdf*, I worked in *Fuel>http://rmod.inria.fr/web/software/Fuel/*, an object serialization framework for *Pharo>http://pharo.org/*, which has been adopted by the community.
My supervisors were *Hernán Wilkinson>https://www.dc.uba.ar/rrhh/profesores/wilkinson*, *Carlos E. Ferro>https://plus.google.com/106742013239110676404*, and *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/*.
