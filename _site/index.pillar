This site is about me as a programmer and a researcher.

In 2015, I've got a Ph.D. at University of Lille (France) under the supervision of *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/* and *Damien Cassou>http://damiencassou.seasidehosting.st/*. I was part of *RMoD research group>http://rmod.lille.inria.fr/* at *Inria>http://www.inria.fr/*.

Previously, I've studied at the *Departamento de Computación>http://www.dc.uba.ar/*, *Universidad de Buenos Aires>http://dc.uba.ar/*, where I received my degree in Computer Sciences. During my studies, I've worked several years at *Hexacta>http://www.hexacta.com/*, a consulting and software development company at Buenos Aires, Argentina.
