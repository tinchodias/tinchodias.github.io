I am a software engineer for the *Pharo Consortium>https://consortium.pharo.org/*, focused on developing *Bloc>https://github.com/pharo-graphics/Bloc* and its associated graphics library ecosystem.

Up to 2021, I've worked as a research engineer at *Object Profile>http://www.objectprofile.com/*.

During 2018-20, I got a postdoc position at Computer Science Department (*DCC>http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/*) of the *University of Chile>http://www.uchile.cl/* (*Faculty of Engineering>http://www.fcfm.uchile.cl/*).

During 2016-18, I worked as a teacher at *National University of Quilmes>http://www.unq.edu.ar/english/sections/158-unq/*, and also as developer of web applications (please, don't take this web page as a sample ;)).

In 2015, I've got a Ph.D. at *University of Lille>https://www.univ-lille.fr/home/* under the supervision of *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/* and *Damien Cassou>http://damiencassou.seasidehosting.st/*.

In my *thesis>http://rmod.inria.fr/archives/phd/PhD-2015-Dias.pdf* I've worked in software evolution, first-class code changes, code integration activities, and untangling code changes.

Previously, I've studied at *Computer Department>http://www.dc.uba.ar/* of the *University of Buenos Aires>http://www.uba.ar/internacionales/index.php?lang=en*, where I received my degree in Computer Sciences. 
In my *master thesis>http://www.dc.uba.ar/inv/tesis/licenciatura/2012/dias.pdf*, I worked in *Fuel>http://rmod.inria.fr/web/software/Fuel/*, an object serialization framework for *Pharo>http://pharo.org/*, which has been adopted by the community.
