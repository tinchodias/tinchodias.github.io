! About me

I am a software developer with over 20 years of experience in *Pharo>https://pharo.org/* / Smalltalk, Java, C, and other languages. I also have a few years of experience in research and teaching at the university level.

I currently work as a software engineer for the *Pharo Consortium>https://consortium.pharo.org/*, focused on *Bloc>https://github.com/pharo-graphics/Bloc* and its associated graphics library ecosystem.

During 2018-21, I did research and develop software with focus on data visualization with *Alexandre Bergel>https://bergel.eu/*. This happened, first, in the context of a postdoc position at Computer Science Department (*DCC>http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/*) of the *University of Chile>http://www.uchile.cl/* (*Faculty of Engineering>http://www.fcfm.uchile.cl/*), and later as an employee of *Object Profile>http://www.objectprofile.com/*.

During 2016-18, I worked as a teacher at *University of Quilmes>https://www.unq.edu.ar/carrera/58-licenciatura-en-informatica/*, and also as developer of web applications.

In 2015, I've got a Ph.D. at *University of Lille>https://international.univ-lille.fr/* under the supervision of *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/* and *Damien Cassou>http://damiencassou.seasidehosting.st/*. 
I was part of *RMoD research group>https://rmod.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/* at *Inria>http://www.inria.fr/*.
In my *thesis>https://rmod-files.lille.inria.fr/Team/Texts/Phds/PhD-2015-Dias.pdf* I've worked in software evolution, first-class code changes, code integration activities, and untangling code changes.

I did my studies in computer science at the *Computer Department>http://www.dc.uba.ar/* of the *University of Buenos Aires>http://www.uba.ar/internacionales/index.php?lang=en*, where I received my degree in Computer Sciences. 
In my *master thesis>http://gestion.dc.uba.ar/media/academic/grade/thesis/dias.pdf*, I worked in *Fuel>http://rmod.inria.fr/web/software/Fuel/*, an object serialization framework for *Pharo>http://pharo.org/*, which has been adopted by the community.
My supervisors were *Hernán Wilkinson>https://staff.dc.uba.ar/hwilkinson/*, *Carlos E. Ferro>https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-ferro-3025302/*, and *Stéphane Ducasse>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/*.
